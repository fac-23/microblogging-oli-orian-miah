## Introduction

- We have built a microblogging web application using express node.js server to serve our html to the user.

- We built this project as a fun project to learn writing server side code.

---

## Project scope

- Editable posts and likes were not implemented
- Code modularisation was viewed as an enhancement secondary to functionality

---

## Project plan

## User Stories ðŸ‘¥

### Core âœ¨

- As an opinionated person, I want to: post my thoughts so others can read them
- As a bored person, I want to: read what other people have posted

### Stretch ðŸŒ±

- As an impulsive person, I want to: delete my posts so no one can see them anymore
  Acceptance Criteria
- A page with a form to submit posts, and a page showing all posts
- No .html files (all HTML responses should be created dynamically within Node)
- No client-side JavaScript (all logic should happen on the server)
- All static assets served correctly (CSS, favicon etc)
- Tests for each server route
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible

## Team members

- Oli: Scrum master/Facilitator/UX and UI

## Requirement analysis

- Used google lighthouse to check accessibility
- Went for a mobile first design with flexbox
- Add added alt text to image, semantic html, webpage is tabbable

## Project learnings

- Did your team work effectively?
- What would you do differently next time?

* Made good use of the kanban board right from the start
* Used labels to designate tasks
* We made our user stories the core focus of our tests and our approach to the project
* Reviewed our way of working and changed the style.
* After the first day we switched to a 'driver': 'navigator' style of pair programming
* Kanban board and keeping everyone on same page helped with github workflow
* We worked together on most issues, but did split into groups for error route handling and css

- TDD with cypress.
- How to set up an express server.
- Using date object.
- Project set-up, installing package.JSON and running scripts.
- Deployment Heroku.
- Managing GET and POST requests on express.
- Adding a 'catch all' for missing routes to generate a custom 404 page.
- Use of github project board.

## Recommendations and conclusions

Future improvements

- Project modularisation.
- A 'like button'.
- Editing posts.

- Splitting into smaller groups for modular tasks

âœ… Project success! We passed all user stories and all tests
